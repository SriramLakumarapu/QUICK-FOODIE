# QUICK-FOODIE

Quickfoodie is a web application which we have developed to provide a platform to fill a
specific niche in the market by providing small restaurants with the ability to offer their
customers an online ordering option without having to invest large amounts of time and
money in having custom software designed specifically for them. The system, which is
highly customizable, allows the restaurant employees to easily manage the site content,
most importantly the menu, themselves through a very intuitive graphical interface and
this website contains different categories of food. For each category weâ€™ll have different
variety of food. User can browse all categories and food items and can also order the
food. Admin can add update or delete food and its categories, they can also manage and
track food order and delivery.
